# Eduscout

Full source for `eduscount.ai`, a college application prep tool that leverages AI.

### Clone and Deploy

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/storage/postgres-prisma
```

Once that's done, copy the .env.example file in this directory to .env.local (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and set the environment variables to match the ones in your Vercel Storage Dashboard.

Next, run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
